# Denoising Medical Image
Denoising Medical Image with Difference GAN

## ðŸ’¡ Discription
```Diffrence GAN``` refers to a GAN that trains adversarially with a difference map to be denoised like a Target (ndct).  
Since Input (qdct) and Target (ndct) are similar, Output (pred) can also look like Input, but considering diff, there is an effect of making it closer to Target.
